This directory contains a baseline implementation of the package parser
implemented as a Bro script.  A .bro file contains a script that can be
executed on a Modbus pcap dump.  A .log file contains an example for an
output file generated by this script.  By convention, the sample log file
should contain the first 100 lines of a real log file obtained from running
the script on packets_00014_20161128135616.cap.

Currently, the scripts only handle the read_holding_registers event.  Other
events can handled by simply copying and adapting the existing handlers.
